# Weather Application:
This website is designed to keep user's informed about the weather specifically in their respective city. Users are able to search via city name and are presented with the current weather, humidity, and wind speeds of that city. Users are also presented with a 5-day forecast and buttons for their most recent searches.

# Instructions for usage:
Navigate over to the search bar and type in a city you want the weather for. Then, once you've entered in a city, hit 'search'. This page should then populate with accurate weather information based on the city you've just entered. Additionally, you are able to see and select your recent searches on the left-hand side of the screen. Just click one of your recent searches and you'll head right back to the city you've just entered. Happy forecasting!
